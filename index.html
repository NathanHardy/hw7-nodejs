            <h3>Mister Web Developer person. I would like for you to tell me about what is the Node.</h3>
            <p>Node is essentially a set of libraries written on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine for Chrome. These libraries help to simplify networking and certain server-side functionality. Wikipedia defines Node.js as follows:</p>
            <p><i>Node.js is an open source cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript...</i></p>
            <p>Similar functionality can be achieved with more traditional server-side programming languages, such as PHP, however there are differences. For example, Node includes an API for non-blocking I/O, which means that multiple connections can be handled on a single thread, each of which can idle, but cannot sleep, which would delay execution of other connections. This makes Node ideal for realtime web applications. Another nice feature is a library built into Node which allows applications to serve as a web server without requiring Apache HTTP or a similar solution. These and other features have made Node a fast growing and highly in-demand technology, which is now used by GoDaddy, Groupon, LinkedIn, Microsoft, PayPal, SAP, Walmart, and Yahoo, among many others.</p>
        <h3>Thank you mister guy who makes websites do things. But can you link me to further information?</h3>
            <p>If you want further information on Node from someone who knows it better than me (but is far more long-winded), here are some useful links:

            <p>I know slightly more than this dog. Enough to make this web page. Remember kids, C's get degrees, and C#'s get jobs!</p>
            <h3>That's a cute dog! Can I play with that dog?</h3>
            <p>I am not internet famous enough to facilitate such a meeting. I'm sure that the dog who invented Facebook has many important things to do. Only sultans get to rub his tummy and throw the ball for him. He sleeps on a bed made of other beds that he has torn up (without being scolded by an owner), which were previously made of silk and the feathers of extinct birds (I hear they were especially soft and tasty). He eats nothing but cats with gold shavings.</p>
